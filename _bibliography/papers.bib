  title={Independent fiscal institutions: A typology of OECD institutions and a roadmap for Latin America},
  author={Caldera Sanchez, A.; Garda, P.; Gonzalez Pandiella, A.; Maravalle, A.; Rodriguez, D. and Vidal, E.},
  abstract={The paper reviews the diverse experience of OECD countries in establishing and running independent fiscal institutions, offering insights that could be useful for Latin American countries seeking to set-up and strengthen those institutions in the region. Through cluster analysis, we identify different types of OECD independent fiscal institutions and draw practical lessons from cases studies. We also identify key features that could serve as a road map for Latin American countries in their efforts to establish or enhance independent fiscal institutions.},

  title={Dynamics of service inflation},
  author={Bajraj G.; Rodriguez, D.; Wlasiuk J.M. and Zelpo, G.},
  abstract={This analysis highlights the unusual persistence and global synchronization of services inflation following the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, contrasting with the more contained trends in goods, food, and energy inflation. Dynamic factor models indicate that the global factor explaining services inflation variance surged from 15% pre-pandemic to 50% post-pandemic. This phenomenon stems from synchronized shocks and policy responses, with services prices lagging behind overall inflation but now recovering. Projections suggest services inflation may return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2025, although risks remain due to heightened persistence in high-inflation periods and country-specific factors such as fiscal policies and geopolitical events.},

  title={Copper Prices},
  author={Carlomagno, G.; Lorca J.; Riquelme, V.; Rodriguez, D.; and Zelpo, G.},
  abstract={The recent rise in copper prices, driven by supply constraints and robust demand fueled by the global energy transition, has prompted a revision in the projected price for 2024-2026 from $3.85 to $4.30 per pound in the central IPoM scenario. While part of this increase is linked to transitory factors, such as speculative activity and risk appetite, over half is expected to persist due to structural demand shifts and geopolitical influences. This sustained rise is anticipated to stimulate mining investment and related sectors, improve terms of trade, and contribute to peso appreciation, impacting domestic demand and inflation. The effects on monetary policy and economic dynamics will continue to be assessed.},

  title={Risks to International inflation convergence},
  author={Pustilnik, B.; Rodriguez D.; Reszczynkski, M. T.; and Wlasiuk J. M.},
  abstract={The decline in global inflation since mid-2022 has been driven primarily by falling goods prices, aided by normalized supply chains, lower transportation costs, and reduced commodity prices. However, services inflation remains high, and recent reversals in deflationary pressures—such as rising transportation costs and an uncertain energy outlook—pose risks. China’s macroeconomic slowdown has contributed to disinflation, but this effect may diminish if its consumption and industrial output stabilize. These factors add uncertainty to the pace of global inflation convergence, with supply-side contributions to disinflation waning and new pressures emerging.},
