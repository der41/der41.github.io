These policies acted simultaneously worldwide.</li> <li>The rebalancing of relative prices between goods and services: Following the pandemic, service prices fell behind the general price level as goods inflation surged. Much of the recent increase in services inflation has been driven by a correction in these relative prices. However, the process is essentially complete, with limited scope for further rebalancing to contribute to inflation normalization.</li> </ul> <div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/relative_price2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/relative_price2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/relative_price2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/relative_price2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <hr/> <h2 id="risks-of-persistent-services-inflation">Risks of Persistent Services Inflation</h2> <p>Evidence suggests that service inflation tends to be more persistent during periods of high overall inflation due to indexation mechanisms.

While persistence has eased recently, it remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, posing a risk of delayed normalization.</p> <p>Furthermore, country-specific factors also contribute to the dynamics of services inflation, including Monetary and fiscal policies, migration trends, changes in productivity and investor sentiment, and geopolitical developments affecting global goods prices.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="what-lies-ahead">What Lies Ahead?</h2> <p>The path to normalizing services inflation will likely extend over the next few quarters. Several factors could slow this process, such as intensified indexation mechanisms during the inflationary spike, resilient consumer demand in key markets like the US, and Country-specific dynamics affecting relative price adjustments. While total inflation may continue to ease, services inflation remains a wildcard that could delay full convergence to pre-pandemic levels, especially in economies with resilient demand and policy-driven price adjustments.</p>]]></content><author><name>Diego Rodriguez</name></author><category term="Economy"/><category term="Inflation"/><category term="Global"/><category term="Analytics"/><category term="ML"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inflation in services has become a defining feature of the current economic landscape, diverging sharply from trends in goods, food, and energy prices.

They don’t always get the spotlight but are crucial for ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust in public spending. A recent OECD report dives into how IFIs are structured worldwide and what Latin America can learn from their experiences.</p> <h3 id="what-exactly-are-ifis">What Exactly Are IFIs?</h3> <p>Think of IFIs as the fiscal equivalent of referees in a sports game. Their job is to call out overspending, keep forecasts realistic, and ensure budgetary rules aren’t just words on paper. For example, the US has the Congressional Budget Office to share reliable spending and income with the government. But here’s the thing—no two IFIs are the same. To understand their diversity, in this document we use a statistical approach called k-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to group IFIs based on their size, mandate, and functions.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="k-means">K-means</h2> <p>Imagine sorting a big pile of fiscal institutions into groups without knowing much about them beforehand. Clustering looks for patterns in the data—grouping IFIs with similar tasks and resources—while ensuring the groups are as distinct as possible. For example, k-means minimizes differences within a group and maximizes differences between groups by organizing the data around “centroids” (essentially, the center of a group).</p> <p>Using K-means, four distinct clusters of IFIs are revealed :</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/IFIs_2024_Clusters-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/IFIs_2024_Clusters-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/IFIs_2024_Clusters-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/IFIs_2024_Clusters.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <ol> <li>Small but mighty: These are focused on monitoring compliance with fiscal rules, often with limited resources. Consider them specialists—like Ireland’s Fiscal Advisory Council—keeping governments honest about spending.</li> <li>Medium-sized multitaskers: Adding more complexity to their role, these IFIs assess compliance while conducting policy costing and macroeconomic analysis. Spain’s fiscal council, AIReF, is a prime example.</li> <li>Parliamentary Budget Offices (PBOs): These focus on supporting legislators, responding to specific requests, and performing policy costings. Canada’s PBO, for instance, delivers tailored fiscal analysis directly to parliamentarians.</li> <li>Big players: These are the heavyweights, producing official macroeconomic forecasts and handling complex, resource-intensive tasks. The Netherlands’ CPB Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis is a standout here.</li> </ol> <p>Each type serves its purpose, and its design reflects the fiscal priorities and maturity of the country they are in. For example, smaller IFIs often emerge in nations just starting to focus on fiscal discipline, while larger ones thrive in countries with well-established governance systems. We interviewed good practices in each cluster to understand better what set them apart in their task toward better fiscal policies.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="interviews">Interviews</h2> <h3 id="leaders-within-each-cluster-and-lessons-learned">Leaders within each Cluster and lessons learned</h3> <p>What sets successful Independent Fiscal Institutions (IFIs) apart? Drawing from OECD experiences, it comes down to three essential pillars:</p> <p>Independence is Non-Negotiable Autonomy is critical for any IFI to thrive. Legal protection, multi-year budgets, and the ability to hire staff independently ensure these institutions are shielded from political influence. Without true independence, IFIs risk being seen as mere extensions of the government, undermining their credibility. Inspired by the Independence of the US Congressional Budget Office, Korea’s National Assembly Budget Office (NABO) began with a limited scope. Over time, it expanded to cover long-term forecasts, program evaluations, and bill costings, supporting the legislature in overseeing the executive branch.</p> <p>Transparency is a Superpower IFIs must communicate their findings clearly and accessibly to the public, media, and policymakers. Transparent reports and open dialogue build trust and amplify their impact on fiscal policy. Illustrative is the case of Spain’s AIReF, which faced challenges accessing information in its early days. Through transparent reporting and a broad mandate—including monitoring fiscal rules and conducting policy costing—it built a strong reputation as a reliable and independent institution</p> <p>Start Small, Then Grow Many successful IFIs began with narrowly focused mandates, gradually expanding as they built credibility and capacity. Chile, for instance, transitioned from an advisory council to a fully autonomous fiscal council in 2019. This shift enabled it to address pressing issues, including budgetary sustainability and public trust, especially during economic strain like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="lessons-for-latam">Lessons for LATAM</h2> <p>What This Means for Latin America Post-COVID, many Latin American countries are grappling with high debt and tighter budgets. Stronger IFIs can help manage this crisis by promoting responsible policies and rebuilding trust.</p> <p>Start small, but aim high. Begin with a clear, narrow mandate, then expand as credibility grows. Stay and defend the independent framework. Legal and operational autonomy should be baked into the design and long-term planning. Communicate, communicate, communicate. Even the best analysis won’t matter if no one understands or trusts it. Latin America has a significant opportunity to learn from global best practices and set up IFIs that genuinely make a difference. Because when public finances are transparent and accountable, everybody wins.</p>]]></content><author><name>Diego Rodriguez</name></author><category term="Economy"/><category term="Latam"/><category term="Fiscal"/><category term="Analytics"/><category term="ML"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A summary of the original paper published on the OECD]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Real Estate Sector in China</title><link href="https://der41.github.io/blog/2023/distill/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Real Estate Sector in China"/><published>2023-11-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://der41.github.io/blog/2023/distill</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://der41.github.io/blog/2023/distill/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="context">Context</h2> <p>The real estate sector represents a significant portion of China’s economy. <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/rogoff/publications/peak-china-housing">Rogoff and Yang (2021)</a> estimate that, prior to the sector’s crisis, its contribution to the economy—including related industries—accounted for approximately 30% of GDP. This figure is well above the median of 16% of GDP for developed countries analyzed in their study. The sector’s boom was driven by increasing demand for urbanization, economic growth, and government policies favoring investment over the past decade.</p> <p>In China, properties account for more than 50% of household wealth (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043951X21000730">Li and Zhang, 2021</a>)<d-footnote> In the study by Li and Zhang, real estate as household wealth in European countries reaches a maximum of 30%, while in the United Kingdom, the figure is slightly above 10%.</d-footnote>, and land sales contribute roughly 30% of local government revenues (<a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/why-chinas-housing-policies-have-failed">Huang, 2023</a>). Given China’s global economic significance, and its particular importance for Chile, monitoring the state of its real estate market is of special interest. This blog analyzes the causes of the current crisis and its outlook.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="imbalances">Imbalances</h2> <p>China’s real estate market has been undergoing a severe contraction since 2021. Over the past two years, housing sales and new housing starts have plummeted by 30% and 60%, respectively (Figure 1). At the same time, housing prices have fallen by around 10% in some cities. This deterioration is attributed to two structural problems:</p> <ol> <li>An oversupply of housing, particularly in lower-income cities;</li> <li>Financial vulnerabilities accumulated by real estate developers during the expansion years.</li> </ol> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0; overflow: hidden;"> <iframe frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" scrolling="no" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15568110/embed?auto=1" style="box-sizing:border-box; width:700px; height:560px; object-fit: cover; object-position: top;" title="Interactive or visual content"> </iframe> </div> <p>Several factors explain the oversupply in China’s housing market. On one hand, for many years, there was a high pace of construction, encouraged by government policies as part of its growth strategy. On the other hand, structural factors have weakened demand and are expected to continue doing so in the future. Specifically, population aging and slowing migration flows have reduced demand and are likely to persist in the coming years (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/09/29/A-Tale-of-Tier-3-Cities-524064">Rogoff and Yang, 2022</a>). Additionally, demographic growth is expected to turn negative, homeownership rates are high (90%), and the average age of housing stock is relatively low.</p> <p>In recent years, demand has also been impacted by the pandemic and the real estate market crisis, which has further dampened demand due to doubts about the financial health of developers and declining housing prices.</p> <p>The second structural problem is the financial fragility accumulated by real estate developers. Over the past 20 years, developers accrued debt (from households, banks, and others) at a faster rate than the growth of their assets, leading to an increase in the liabilities-to-assets ratio from about 70% to 80% (Figure 2). This debt increase was driven by government policies favoring the sector and by the developers’ business model.</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0; overflow: hidden;"> <iframe frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" scrolling="no" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15567856/embed?auto=1" style="box-sizing:border-box; width:700px; height:560px; object-fit: cover; object-position: top;" title="Interactive or visual content"> </iframe> </div> <p>This model relies on rapid project turnover, heavy dependence on pre-sales, and significant leverage. A typical cycle involves a developer obtaining pre-sale funds for a housing unit and securing loans from various financial intermediaries to purchase land from local governments. The developer then begins construction, selling unfinished homes years before completion to buyers who start paying mortgages before the houses are fully built. One key vulnerability of this business model is the potential for severe liquidity pressures if any steps in this cycle fail (<a href="https://www.piie.com/publications/working-papers/why-chinas-housing-policies-have-failed">Huang, 2023</a>).</p> <p>These issues significantly affected the sector’s activity after the introduction of various government policies aimed at controlling the debt levels of real estate developers. In particular, the “three red lines” policy introduced by the Chinese government in August 2020 set limits on three financial ratios that developers must meet in order to access new credit. Following this policy, only three developers met all the criteria, while the rest failed to meet at least one. Notably, Evergrande, Sunac, and Greenland failed to meet all three. With the contraction of the sector and accumulated vulnerabilities, many companies have experienced significant liquidity and/or solvency problems in recent years, including Evergrande and Country Garden<d-footnote>An example of this is the situation with Evergrande (IEF, second half of 2021) and Country Garden (La Tercera, 2023). </d-footnote>. As a result, these companies have seen significant drops in their valuations, which have not yet recovered (Figure 3).</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0; overflow: hidden;"> <iframe frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" scrolling="no" src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/15568021/embed?auto=1" style="box-sizing:border-box; width:700px; height:560px; object-fit: cover; object-position: top;" title="Interactive or visual content"> </iframe> </div> <p>Since then, the authorities have implemented various measures to support the sector, though these have had limited effects. Among these measures, packages to restore financing channels for developers and relaxations of restrictions on home purchases for families stand out. As of September this year, the effects have been modest, in a context where consumer confidence remains at historically low levels, housing prices continue to fall, and doubts persist about the financial health of developers. Recently, an expansion of the fiscal deficit by 0.8% of GDP was announced to address the slowdown. This stimulus, to be implemented immediately, could provide some relief (likely temporary) to the sector.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2> <p>The sector’s and China’s economic outlook will depend on how the government’s response evolves. If the current situation persists, with relatively limited stimulus efforts, the sector is likely to face a prolonged adjustment, resulting in slow economic growth compared to historical trends. However, if more fiscal stimulus is implemented to reactivate activity and boost confidence, as recently announced, economic activity will likely recover more strongly in the short term but will increase the risk associated with the country’s elevated sovereign debt levels. A bailout for struggling companies also carries the risk of increasing sovereign debt and potential moral hazard. Lastly, a restructuring of developers’ debt will affect the financial situation of households and banks.</p> <p>Despite the challenges, China’s situation has two key mitigating factors compared to past crises in other economies. On one hand, the country has accumulated current account surpluses over the last few decades, which limits the possibility of a sudden stop due to a loss of confidence in the country. Additionally, despite the high exposure of the banking sector to the real estate market, the greater prevalence of state ownership in banks reduces the likelihood of a banking crisis in this context.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ul> <li>Rogoff, Kenneth, and Yuanchen Yang. 2021. “Has China’s Housing Production Peaked?” China and the World Economy 21 (1): 1-31.</li> <li>Cheng Li, Ying Zhang. 2021. “How does housing wealth affect household consumption?

Being part of the Microsoft suite, it directly connects to services like Azure, SQL Server, and Excel, making it a top choice for companies across the globe. In 2022, four out of five Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. used Microsoft Office 365, highlighting its widespread adoption.</p> <p>Power BI’s user-friendly interface allows analysts to quickly create dashboards by simply clicking through the tool—no advanced programming knowledge is required. This simplicity enables users to leverage its capabilities without diving deep into DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Power BI’s advanced analytics language. For those unfamiliar, DAX combines SQL-like database management with the syntax familiarity of Excel, making it approachable yet powerful for complex tasks.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <h3 id="applying-powerbi-to-a-github-dataset">Applying PowerBI to a GitHub Dataset</h3> <p>I worked with the World Economic Outlook (WEO) dataset from the FMI, published in a GitHub repository, to demonstrate how easy it is to use Power BI. Within 15 minutes, I could upload the data, configure basic visuals, and analyze key metrics for a particular country. This level of accessibility makes Power BI an ideal tool for analysts working on tight deadlines or requiring on-the-go reporting.</p> <div class="l-page" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; margin: 20px 0; overflow: hidden;"> <iframe title="Weo" width="700" height="480" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYzJjYzVjNzUtNTRmNC00Yzc5LWI5ZTMtM2JlYjBhNzU0MWIzIiwidCI6ImNiNzJjNTRlLTRhMzEtNGQ5ZS1iMTRhLTFlYTM2ZGZhYzk0YyIsImMiOjF9" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe> </div> <h3 id="complex-uses">Complex Uses</h3> <p>For organizations managing multiple relational databases or requiring granular data insights, Power BI offers even greater capabilities. Users can navigate between pages for deeper analysis with dynamic text and drill-through functionality. For example, in a dashboard analyzing the U.S. macroeconomic situation, each visual and text element dynamically connects to additional pages, offering further insights into key indicators.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/PowerBI-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/PowerBI-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/PowerBI-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/PowerBI.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <hr/> <h2 id="why-power-bi">Why Power BI?</h2> <p>Suppose your organization relies on relational databases and needs to deliver actionable insights to key stakeholders.

Each day can bring a completely new dataset, and keeping track of it all can feel overwhelming—especially when you need to plan your activities and timeline based on incoming information.</p> <p>Take the international economy, for example. Before the business day begins, you might already have over 16 new global indicators to process. Some will exceed market forecasts, while others fall short. This pattern repeats daily, with different indicators being released every hour.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/economic_calendar-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/economic_calendar-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/economic_calendar-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/economic_calendar.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <hr/> <h2 id="pagerank">PageRank</h2> <h3 id="how-can-we-organize-this-chaos">How Can We Organize This Chaos?</h3> <p>The simplest inspiration comes from the PageRank algorithm, originally developed by Google to rank web pages. While Google has since evolved its ranking methods, the foundational concept remains powerful.</p> <p>In a nutshell, PageRank assigns a score of importance to each page, based on the principle that a page becomes more important if other important pages link to it. It’s a recursive system: the importance of a page is determined by the importance of the pages linking to it.As Eric Roberts from Stanford describes, you can imagine a random surfer clicking through links on the web. The PageRank of any given page is the probability that the surfer will land on it. Pages with more incoming links from important sources are more likely to attract the surfer, and thus rank higher in search results. You can find a link to his slides <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs54n/handouts/24-GooglePageRankAlgorithm.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p>This same logic can be applied to dynamic data. While PageRank used hyperlinks as the core measure for cataloging the early internet, we can adapt its principles to organize economic indicators—leveraging domain knowledge about the data to create a meaningful ranking system.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="application">Application</h2> <h3 id="applying-pagerank-principles-to-economic-data">Applying PageRank Principles to Economic Data</h3> <p>To make sense of chaotic economic data, we need to answer some key questions about the information:</p> <ol> <li>Do we know the frequency of the data release?</li> <li>How valuable is this information each time it’s updated?</li> <li>Are there other characteristics that help predict its relevance and usage?</li> <li>Can we generate metrics that improve our summaries of incoming data?</li> </ol> <p>Answering these questions with confidence allows us to rank the data effectively. This, in turn, enables more efficient querying and retrieval of relevant information, whether it’s data that’s about to be released or historical data for comparison.</p> <p>Let’s use an example. Below is a lookup table that synthesizes the importance of different economic indicators for workflow planning.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Country</th> <th>Data</th> <th>Coming Up Next Week</th> <th>Importance for Workflow</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>USA</td> <td>Employment</td> <td>Yes (1)</td> <td>Very High (5)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>USA</td> <td>Factory Orders</td> <td>Yes (1)</td> <td>Medium (3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>USA</td> <td>Consumer Confidence</td> <td>No (0)</td> <td>High (4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EU</td> <td>Consumer Confidence</td> <td>Yes (1)</td> <td>High (4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GER</td> <td>Factory Orders</td> <td>Yes (1)</td> <td>Low (1)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CHN</td> <td>Aggregate Social Finance</td> <td>No (0)</td> <td>Very High (5)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In this table:</p> <p>“Coming Up Next Week” is a binary indicator of whether the data will be released soon. “Importance for Workflow” reflects how critical the information is for decision-making. By combining these metrics, we calculate a final score (e.g., by multiplying the two values) to prioritize incoming data.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="python-example">Python Example</h2> <h3 id="from-manual-tracking-to-automation">From Manual Tracking to Automation</h3> <p>Here’s how Python can be used to streamline this process. First, create a DataFrame with your lookup table and another DataFrame holding the forecast, expected, and previous values of the data. Then, merge these tables, calculate the scores, and sort the data to highlight the most critical updates.</p> <div class="jupyter-notebook" style="position: relative; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;"> <div class="jupyter-notebook-iframe-container"> <iframe src="/assets/jupyter/pagerank.ipynb.html" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; border-style: none;" width="100%" height="100%" onload="this.parentElement.style.paddingBottom = (this.contentWindow.document.documentElement.scrollHeight + 10) + 'px'"></iframe> </div> </div> <p>This process scales seamlessly. While the example only involves six data entries, the same logic applies to organizing thousands of entries weekly. By automating with lookup tables and scripts, you can shift your focus from manual tracking to strategic analysis.</p> <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2> <h3 id="a-smarter-way-to-manage-dynamic-data">A Smarter Way to Manage Dynamic Data</h3> <p>By borrowing ideas from PageRank and leveraging domain knowledge, you can transform chaotic streams of key indicators into a structured, actionable workflow.
