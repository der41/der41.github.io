I am a graduate student at Duke University, pursuing a Master of Interdisciplinary Data Science. My academic journey spans the domains of artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure, and process automation. I am passionate about developing scalable, data-driven solutions to tackle systemic challenges, with a focus on enhancing organizational efficiency.

Prior to joining Duke, I worked as a data analyst, where I led automation initiatives that optimized workflows at the Central Bank of Chile. These projects not only improved efficiency but also deepened my interest in the intersection of data science, digital transformation, and public policy. Among my most rewarding experiences was designing customized automated systems that addressed specific institutional needs, solidifying my drive to understand and improve complex information ecosystems.

My academic foundation includes a dual Certificate in Data Analytics from MIT and the University of Chile, as well as a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and Management from the University of Chile. These programs ignited my passion for applying data-driven approaches to real-world problems. I have also collaborated on analytical projects with leading institutions such as the OECD and the Central Bank of Chile, focusing on policy evaluation and enhancing data-driven decision-making processes for policymakers.

My research interests lie in machine learning, process automation, and digital governance. I am particularly intrigued by the potential of artificial intelligence to transform public service delivery, address inequality, and create accessible systems for underserved communities.
