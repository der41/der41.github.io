# Optionally, you can add a table of contents to your post.
# NOTES:
#   - make sure that TOC names match the actual section names
#     for hyperlinks within the post to work correctly.
#   - we may want to automate TOC generation in the future using
#     jekyll-toc plugin (https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc).
toc:
  - name: Context
    # if a section has subsections, you can add them as follows:
    # subsections:
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 1
    #   - name: Example Child Subsection 2
  - name: PageRank
  - name: Application
  - name: Conclusions

## Context:

### Data Visualization tools

Power BI has become a leading tool for many organizations, offering robust features and seamless integration with Microsoft’s ecosystem. Being part of the Microsoft suite, it directly connects to services like Azure, SQL Server, and Excel, making it a top choice for companies across the globe. In 2022, four out of five Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. used Microsoft Office 365, highlighting its widespread adoption.

Power BI’s user-friendly interface allows analysts to quickly create dashboards by simply clicking through the tool—no advanced programming knowledge is required. This simplicity enables users to leverage its capabilities without diving deep into DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), Power BI’s advanced analytics language. For those unfamiliar, DAX combines SQL-like database management with the syntax familiarity of Excel, making it approachable yet powerful for complex tasks.

## Example

### Applying PowerBI to a GitHub Dataset

I worked with the World Economic Outlook (WEO) dataset from the FMI, published in a GitHub repository, to demonstrate how easy it is to use Power BI. Within 15 minutes, I could upload the data, configure basic visuals, and analyze key metrics for a particular country. This level of accessibility makes Power BI an ideal tool for analysts working on tight deadlines or requiring on-the-go reporting.

</div>

### Complex Uses

For organizations managing multiple relational databases or requiring granular data insights, Power BI offers even greater capabilities. Users can navigate between pages for deeper analysis with dynamic text and drill-through functionality. For example, in a dashboard analyzing the U.S. macroeconomic situation, each visual and text element dynamically connects to additional pages, offering further insights into key indicators.
